# PlCrashReporter Analyzer#

## Introduction ##

**PlCrashReporter Analyzer** is a set of Java utilities that allow you to parse and interpret non-symbolicated dumps generated by [PlCrashReporter](http://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/).

It has two methods:

 * getCrashReport() - returns a string in the same format as an Apple crash log suitable for symbolication.
 * getCrashFingerPrint() - returns a hash of the crash that should uniquely identify it.  Suitable for sorting a large number of crashes by type.
